This repository was born as a personal challenge, to try my hand at writing code that would get out of my comfort zone and embrace as many languages as possible.

This little project aims to implement a series of simple programs, in as many languages as possible, that convert a bitmap image into an ascii-art file. 

<p align="center"><b>STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT</b></p>

## Features

A few of the things you can do with this repo:

* Create ascii-art from an arbitrary image
* Load images in different bitmap formats 
* Close or lock issues
* Set your own set dictionaries with which to compose the result or stick with the default one
* Resize the output according to your needs
* Look at a clean commented code ;)
